# Facial Recognition Attendance System – Project Steps

## **Step 1: Set up the project environment**

* Create project folder and clone repo from GitHub
* Create Python virtual environment (`venv`)
* Activate the environment
* Install required packages (`opencv-python`, `face_recognition`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`, etc.)

---

## **Step 2: Prepare the dataset**

* Create `dataset/` folder
* Add one subfolder per person with their images:

```
dataset/
    Aditya/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
    Raju/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
```

* Ensure **multiple images per person** for better model accuracy
* Images should include different angles and lighting conditions

---

## **Step 3: Extract face embeddings**

* Load images from `dataset/`
* Detect faces using `face_recognition` or `dlib`
* Compute **face embeddings** (feature vectors)
* Store embeddings and corresponding labels

---

## **Step 4: Train the classifier**

* Use embeddings as input
* Train a **classifier** (SVM or KNN) to map embeddings → person names
* Save the trained model (`face_recognition_model.pkl`) in `models/` folder

---

## **Step 5: Test the classifier on images**

* Load the saved model
* Predict names on test images
* Evaluate basic accuracy (optional)

---

## **Step 6: Implement real-time webcam attendance**

* Open webcam feed using OpenCV
* Detect faces in each frame
* Compute embeddings for detected faces
* Use classifier to recognize faces
* Draw bounding boxes and labels on the video
* Maintain a **list of recognized people** as attendance

---

## **Step 7: Optional UI / Dashboard**

* Use Streamlit to display:

  * Webcam feed
  * Attendance table in real-time
* Add functionality to **export attendance to CSV**

---

## **Step 8: Refinement & Testing**

* Test with multiple people simultaneously
* Handle unknown faces gracefully (`Unknown`)
* Add more images if accuracy is low
* Optionally implement logging or notifications

---

## **Step 9: Resume / Project Showcase**

* Highlight:

  * Real-time facial recognition
  * Automated attendance system
  * Use of embeddings + classifier
  * Live webcam and optional Streamlit UI

If you want, I can **now write a ready-to-run `train.py` and `app.py`** that follows this exact sequence, so you can start building immediately.

Do you want me to do that next?
